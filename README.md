Spherical Eye Scaling Module

This module provides functionality for creating an eye joint system in Autodesk Maya using Python and MEL commands.
It computes distances between transform nodes and generates a joint hierarchy based on user-defined guides.

Features
- Compute Euclidean distance between two transform nodes.
- Create an eye joint system using center, radius, and pupil guides.
- Utilize quaternion math for scaling and positioning joints.
